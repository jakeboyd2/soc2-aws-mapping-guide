### Key Audit Questions and Answers

**Q: How does the organization identify security risks?**  
A: Through automated tools (GuardDuty, Security Hub, Inspector, Macie) and formal quarterly risk assessments. Evidence: Risk register, GuardDuty findings, Inspector reports.

**Q: How are risks analyzed and prioritized?**  
A: Using a risk scoring matrix (likelihood × impact) with automated risk score calculation. Evidence: Risk register with scores, vulnerability prioritization reports.

**Q: What is the organization's risk response strategy?**  
A: Risks are treated through avoidance, mitigation, transfer, or acceptance with documented justification. Evidence: Risk treatment plans, acceptance records.

**Q: How does the organization monitor for new and emerging risks?**  
A: Continuous monitoring via GuardDuty, Security Hub, threat intelligence feeds, and quarterly assessments. Evidence: CloudWatch dashboards, weekly reports.

**Q: How are high-severity findings responded to?**  
A: Automated response within 1 hour for critical findings, with isolation, credential revocation, and forensics. Evidence: Lambda execution logs, SNS notifications, remediation tickets.

## Cost Optimization

### Estimated Monthly Costs

| Service | Cost Driver | Estimated Cost |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **GuardDuty** | Data analyzed (CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, DNS) | $50-500/account |
| **Security Hub** | Finding ingestion, compliance checks | $0.10/10k findings |
| **Inspector** | Instance scans, container images | $0.30/instance/month |
| **Macie** | S3 data scanned | $1.25/GB scanned |
| **Config** | Configuration items recorded | $0.003/item |
| **Lambda** | Automated response executions | $5-20/month |
| **S3 Storage** | Evidence and reports | $1-10/month |
| **SNS/SES** | Alerting and reporting | $1-5/month |

**Total Estimated Cost**: $500-2,000/month for medium organization (10-50 accounts)

### Cost Optimization Tips
1. Use GuardDuty finding export to S3 to reduce Security Hub costs
2. Configure Inspector to scan only production resources initially
3. Use Macie discovery jobs selectively rather than continuous scanning
4. Leverage AWS Config conformance packs instead of individual rules
5. Use S3 lifecycle policies to archive old evidence to Glacier

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### GuardDuty Not Generating Findings
- **Check**: Detector enabled in all regions
- **Check**: VPC Flow Logs and DNS logs enabled
- **Check**: Trusted IP list not blocking legitimate findings
- **Solution**: Review GuardDuty configuration, enable all data sources

### Security Hub Score Low
- **Check**: Which controls are failing
- **Check**: If failures are false positives
- **Solution**: Prioritize high-impact control failures, suppress non-applicable findings

### Inspector Not Scanning Resources
- **Check**: SSM agent installed on EC2 instances
- **Check**: Inspector enabled for resource types
- **Check**: IAM permissions for Inspector
- **Solution**: Install SSM agent, verify Inspector enablement

### Automated Remediation Not Working
- **Check**: Lambda execution logs for errors
- **Check**: IAM permissions for Lambda roles
- **Check**: EventBridge rule pattern matching
- **Solution**: Review CloudWatch Logs, adjust IAM policies

### High False Positive Rate
- **Check**: GuardDuty trusted IP lists
- **Check**: Security Hub suppression rules
- **Solution**: Tune detection rules, create suppressions for known-good patterns
