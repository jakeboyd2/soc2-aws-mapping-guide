CC6.1,MFA Enforcement,The entity requires multi-factor authentication for all users accessing systems containing sensitive data,AWS IAM,"Security Hub, Config",1. Enable MFA for root account<br>2. Require MFA for IAM users<br>3. Set up Config rule to monitor<br>4. Configure SCP to enforce,"Config rule compliance status, IAM user details showing MFA devices",AWS Console ? Config ? Rules ? iam-user-mfa-enabled,Easy ,$0 (Free),2 Hours,Use AWS managed Config rules. Consider virtual MFA apps for cost savings.
CC6.2,Password Requirements,Establish and enforce strong password policies for user accounts to prevent unauthorized access.,IAM,"AWS SSO, Directory Service","Configure IAM password policy (min length, complexity, expiration). Enforce via AWS Organizations or AWS SSO settings.",Screenshot or export of IAM password policy,IAM Console ? Account Settings ? Password Policy,Easy,$0,0.5,"Ensure policy covers rotation, reuse prevention, and complexity."
CC6.6,Logging of Access and Activities,Enable and retain audit logs for all user and system activity to detect unauthorized access or changes.,CloudTrail,"CloudWatch, S3, GuardDuty",Enable CloudTrail in all regions and integrate with CloudWatch for monitoring. Retain logs in S3 with proper lifecycle policies.,"CloudTrail logs, retention policy evidence",CloudTrail Console ? Trails,Medium,$5–$15,2,Ensure trails are multi-region and immutable. Use S3 Object Lock.
CC6.7,Access Restrictions to Systems,Limit access to systems and resources to authorized users based on least privilege.,IAM,"Organizations, SCPs, SSO",Define IAM roles and policies with least privilege. Use SCPs to restrict access. Review permissions regularly.,"IAM policy JSONs, SCP documentation",IAM Console ? Roles / Policies,Medium,$0,2,Avoid using '*' in policies; regularly audit access.
CC7.2,System Monitoring,Continuously monitor infrastructure for unusual activity or potential security incidents.,CloudWatch,"GuardDuty, Security Hub, CloudTrail","Enable CloudWatch metrics and alarms, integrate GuardDuty and Security Hub for detection and response.","Monitoring dashboards, alert configuration",CloudWatch Console ? Alarms / Metrics,Medium,$10–$25,3,Set up alert thresholds carefully; integrate with SNS for notifications.
CC7.4,Data Backup Procedures,Ensure data is regularly backed up and can be restored to maintain availability and integrity.,Backup,"S3, RDS, EBS, Glacier","Configure AWS Backup plans for key resources (RDS, EBS, DynamoDB). Test recovery procedures periodically.","Backup plan configuration, recovery logs",AWS Backup Console ? Backup plans,Medium,$10–$50,3,Verify cross-region backups and retention policies.
CC8.1,Change Authorization,Require approval and documentation for changes to production systems.,CodePipeline,"CloudFormation, Service Catalog, Config",Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with approval stages in CodePipeline. Enable AWS Config for tracking changes.,"Change approval records, Config change history",CodePipeline Console ? Pipelines / AWS Config ? Timeline,Medium,$5–$20,4,Link change requests to tickets in Jira/ServiceNow.
A1.1,System Availability Monitoring,Monitor system uptime and performance to ensure availability meets SLA.,CloudWatch,"Health Dashboard, CloudTrail","Create CloudWatch metrics and alarms for instance uptime, latency, and error rates.",CloudWatch dashboards and alarms,CloudWatch Console ? Metrics / Dashboards,Easy,$5–$10,2,"Include application-level metrics, not just EC2 uptime."
A1.2,Redundancy / Failover,Design infrastructure to tolerate component failures and maintain availability.,Route 53,"ELB, Auto Scaling, Multi-AZ RDS",Deploy workloads in multiple AZs or regions. Configure Route 53 health checks and failover routing.,"Architecture diagram, test results",Route 53 Console ? Health Checks / Failover,Hard,$25–$100+,5,Periodically test failover; verify DNS propagation time.
C1.1,Data Encryption,Protect data at rest and in transit using approved cryptographic standards.,KMS,"S3, EBS, RDS, ACM","Enable default encryption for S3, EBS, and RDS. Use ACM for HTTPS/TLS. Manage keys with KMS policies.","Encryption settings, key policies",KMS Console ? Keys / S3 Console ? Default encryption,Easy,$0–$5,2,Rotate CMKs annually; enforce TLS 1.2+.
