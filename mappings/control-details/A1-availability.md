# A1: Availability 
### Reference: AICPA Trust Services Criteria 2017 (A1.1, A1.2)

## Overview

The **Availability principle (A1)** under the AICPA Trust Services Criteria ensures that **information and systems are available for operation and use to meet the entity’s objectives**.  
According to **A1.1–A1.2**, organizations must maintain, monitor, and manage system capacity, implement recovery infrastructure, and operate safeguards that ensure uptime and resilience.

---

## AWS Services Supporting Availability Controls

AWS provides high-availability infrastructure services that directly align with SOC 2 **A1** requirements.  
Below are **seven mapped controls** leveraging **Auto Scaling**, **Route 53**, and **CloudFront** to demonstrate compliance readiness for availability criteria.

---

### **Control 1: Auto Scaling Capacity Management**
**SOC 2 Mapping:** A1.1 – Maintain and Monitor System Capacity  
**Description:**  
Auto Scaling dynamically adjusts compute resources (e.g., EC2 instances) to maintain consistent performance and prevent system overload.

**Implementation Guidance:**  
- Configure Auto Scaling groups for critical workloads with defined CPU/memory thresholds.  
- Establish CloudWatch alarms to trigger scaling events automatically.  
- Conduct monthly reviews of scaling policies against business demand forecasts.

**GRC Mapping Insight:**  
Auto Scaling provides **evidence of proactive capacity management**, fulfilling A1.1’s focus on monitoring and forecasting system capacity and usage.

---

### **Control 2: Auto Scaling Health Check and Self-Healing**
**SOC 2 Mapping:** A1.2 – Recovery Infrastructure and Operations  
**Description:**  
Auto Scaling replaces unhealthy instances automatically, ensuring system resilience and availability.

**Implementation Guidance:**  
- Enable EC2 health checks and automatic instance replacement.  
- Integrate with Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) for continuous traffic routing.  
- Log health check failures to CloudWatch for periodic control testing.

**GRC Mapping Insight:**  
Demonstrates **continuous monitoring and self-recovery** mechanisms, providing assurance of system restoration in alignment with A1.2.

---

### **Control 3: Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover**
**SOC 2 Mapping:** A1.2 – Recovery Infrastructure  
**Description:**  
Amazon Route 53 provides DNS-based health checks and automated failover routing to backup endpoints during outages.

**Implementation Guidance:**  
- Configure Route 53 health checks on primary application endpoints.  
- Set up failover policies to redirect traffic to secondary AWS regions.  
- Document DNS routing configurations and periodic failover test results.

**GRC Mapping Insight:**  
Supports **business continuity and failover testing**, directly addressing A1.2 requirements for environmental and recovery infrastructure.

---

### **Control 4: Route 53 Latency-Based Routing**
**SOC 2 Mapping:** A1.1 – Capacity and Performance Optimization  
**Description:**  
Latency-based routing directs users to the lowest-latency AWS region, optimizing response times and availability.

**Implementation Guidance:**  
- Implement latency-based routing for global web applications.  
- Measure latency trends with CloudWatch metrics and Route 53 logs.  
- Include route performance metrics in quarterly capacity reports.

**GRC Mapping Insight:**  
Ensures that performance degradation risks are mitigated and **system capacity aligns with service objectives**, fulfilling A1.1 expectations.

---

### **Control 5: CloudFront Edge Caching**
**SOC 2 Mapping:** A1.1 – Manage System Use and Performance  
**Description:**  
Amazon CloudFront caches content globally to reduce origin load and increase application uptime during demand spikes.

**Implementation Guidance:**  
- Configure CloudFront distributions for static and dynamic content.  
- Enable Origin Shield and use regional edge caches.  
- Review cache hit ratios and adjust TTL values for optimal performance.

**GRC Mapping Insight:**  
CloudFront reduces system strain and increases response efficiency, satisfying **capacity and performance management** requirements under A1.1.

---

### **Control 6: CloudFront Origin Failover**
**SOC 2 Mapping:** A1.2 – Backup and Recovery Infrastructure  
**Description:**  
CloudFront supports automatic failover between multiple origins, ensuring content remains accessible even during service disruptions.

**Implementation Guidance:**  
- Configure multiple origins (primary and secondary) in CloudFront distributions.  
- Test failover behavior quarterly and record validation results.  
- Use CloudWatch metrics to monitor failover events and resolution time.

**GRC Mapping Insight:**  
Demonstrates **redundancy and continuity**, providing evidence of recovery capabilities consistent with A1.2.

---

### **Control 7: Regional Distribution and Multi-AZ Deployment**
**SOC 2 Mapping:** A1.1 / A1.2 – Capacity and Availability Resilience  
**Description:**  
Using AWS Multi-AZ and multi-region architectures ensures high fault tolerance and rapid recovery in case of regional disruptions.

**Implementation Guidance:**  
- Deploy applications across multiple Availability Zones or regions.  
- Configure replication (e.g., RDS Multi-AZ, S3 Cross-Region Replication).  
- Periodically test failover to ensure data and service continuity.

**GRC Mapping Insight:**  
Multi-AZ architectures provide **resilience evidence** for audit purposes, verifying design effectiveness and operational testing under A1.1–A1.2.

---

## GRC Audit Preparation Steps

1. **Document Control Ownership** – Assign owners for each AWS control and link to internal BCP/DR policies.  
2. **Maintain Configuration Evidence** – Export Auto Scaling configurations, Route 53 health check settings, and CloudFront failover reports.  
3. **Perform Availability Testing** – Simulate scaling and failover events quarterly and retain test evidence.  
4. **Link Controls to Policies** – Map technical evidence to policies such as Business Continuity, Disaster Recovery, and Capacity Management.  
5. **Provide Continuous Monitoring Reports** – Use CloudWatch dashboards as audit-ready visual evidence of operational uptime and capacity trends.
