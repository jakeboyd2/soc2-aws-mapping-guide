# CC5: Control Activities

## Overview
Under **CC5: Control Activities**, entities must implement and operate control activities that mitigate risks to achieving objectives related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.

These control activities align with the COSO principles (10–12) and ensure that policies and procedures are properly designed, deployed, and monitored.

---

## **Control 1: Configuration Management**

**SOC 2 Reference:** CC5.1 – The entity selects and develops control activities that contribute to risk mitigation.

**Description:**  
Configuration management ensures that systems, applications, and network devices are securely configured according to defined baselines, and that changes are documented, reviewed, and authorized.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Define baseline configurations for all critical systems (servers, databases, network devices, and endpoints).  
2. Use automated tools (e.g., AWS Config, Azure Policy, Ansible) to monitor and enforce compliance with configuration standards.  
3. Implement a change management process requiring review and approval for configuration changes.  
4. Perform regular configuration audits and document exceptions and remediation actions.  
5. Retain configuration snapshots or version control logs for audit evidence.

## **Control 2: Systems Monitoring**

**SOC 2 Reference:** CC5.2 – The entity selects and develops general control activities over technology.

**Description:**  
Systems monitoring ensures that infrastructure, applications, and security components are actively observed for performance, availability, and anomalous activity that may impact objectives.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Deploy centralized monitoring tools (e.g., CloudWatch, Datadog, Splunk, or SIEM platforms).  
2. Define system health metrics and alert thresholds aligned with business impact.  
3. Monitor key logs for security events, unauthorized changes, and resource failures.  
4. Establish escalation and response procedures for alerts.  
5. Review monitoring reports regularly and integrate them with incident response workflows.

## **Control 3: Backup and Data Recovery**

**SOC 2 Reference:** CC5.3 – The entity deploys control activities through policies and procedures that put management directives into action.

**Description:**  
Backups ensure data and system recoverability following disruption, data corruption, or loss. Procedures support business continuity and compliance with data retention policies.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Define and document backup schedules, storage locations, and retention periods.  
2. Implement automated backup processes and monitor backup job completion.  
3. Store backups securely (encrypted, offsite, or in cloud-managed backup systems).  
4. Test data restoration regularly to confirm data integrity and recovery time objectives (RTO/RPO).  
5. Maintain logs of backup and recovery operations for SOC 2 evidence.

## **Control 4: GRC Mapping and Audit Readiness**

**SOC 2 Reference:** CC5.1–CC5.3 – Control activities are selected, developed, and deployed to mitigate risks through policies and procedures.

**Description:**  
Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) teams ensure alignment between implemented controls and SOC 2 criteria by mapping internal controls to relevant SOC 2 requirements and maintaining evidence repositories.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create a **SOC 2 control matrix** mapping internal controls to AICPA criteria (CC1–CC9).  
2. Document ownership, frequency, evidence type, and validation steps for each control.  
3. Use GRC tools (e.g., Drata, Vanta, Archer, ServiceNow GRC) to manage evidence and track compliance.  
4. Conduct quarterly readiness reviews to ensure control operation and evidence accuracy.  
5. Coordinate with auditors to validate mappings and update based on audit feedback.

## **How GRC Teams Can Map Controls to SOC 2 Criteria**

| Control Area           | SOC 2 Reference | Supporting Artifacts                       | GRC Mapping Objective |
|-------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Configuration Management | CC5.1, CC7.1    | Config standards, change logs, scan reports | Ensure baseline security posture is enforced |
| Systems Monitoring       | CC5.2, CC7.2    | Monitoring alerts, SIEM dashboards          | Demonstrate operational visibility and response |
| Backup and Recovery      | CC5.3, A1.3     | Backup schedules, restoration test results  | Prove data recoverability and availability |
| GRC Control Mapping      | CC5.1–CC5.3     | Control matrix, policy documentation        | Show governance oversight and audit readiness |

---

Implementing these four control activities under CC5 ensures the organization maintains secure configurations, monitors system health, protects data integrity, and demonstrates compliance through structured GRC governance. This readiness framework supports a smooth **SOC 2 Type II audit** by aligning operational evidence with AICPA’s Trust Services Criteria.
