# CC7: System Operations

## Overview
The **System Operations (CC7)** criteria ensure that an organization manages and operates its systems to meet security, availability, and processing integrity objectives.  
This includes monitoring, incident detection, vulnerability response, and recovery processes that maintain system resilience and reliability.

Under the AICPA Trust Services Criteria, CC7 encompasses **monitoring controls (CC7.1–CC7.3)** and **incident response controls (CC7.4–CC7.5)**, requiring proactive identification, analysis, and remediation of operational or security events.

The following AWS-based controls demonstrate how **CloudWatch**, **Systems Manager**, and **AWS Backup** support SOC 2 CC7 compliance.

---

## **Control 1: System Performance and Event Monitoring**

**SOC 2 Reference:** CC7.1 – The entity implements system monitoring procedures to identify anomalies or deviations from expected performance.

**AWS Service:** AWS CloudWatch

**Description:**  
CloudWatch provides centralized observability for AWS resources and applications, enabling the organization to detect performance degradation, unauthorized activity, or capacity issues.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Configure **CloudWatch metrics and dashboards** to monitor CPU, memory, and storage utilization.  
2. Establish **CloudWatch Alarms** for threshold breaches (e.g., high latency, CPU spikes, or failed logins).  
3. Aggregate application and infrastructure logs via **CloudWatch Logs**.  
4. Integrate CloudWatch with **SNS** or **incident response tools** for alert notifications.  
5. Periodically review metrics and alarms to validate alignment with operational objectives.

---

## **Control 2: Incident Detection and Response Automation**

**SOC 2 Reference:** CC7.2 – Deviations and incidents are detected, analyzed, and resolved on a timely basis.

**AWS Service:** AWS Systems Manager + CloudWatch

**Description:**  
AWS Systems Manager automates detection and remediation of operational incidents through runbooks, ensuring quick and consistent response to identified system issues.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Integrate **CloudWatch Alarms** with **Systems Manager Automation** runbooks for auto-remediation.  
2. Use **OpsCenter** within Systems Manager to log, prioritize, and assign incidents.  
3. Define **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** for recurring incidents.  
4. Configure automated patching and health checks via **Systems Manager State Manager**.  
5. Document all incident responses for GRC evidence and audit trails.

---

## **Control 3: System Configuration and Patch Management**

**SOC 2 Reference:** CC7.3 – The entity evaluates and remediates identified issues on a timely basis.

**AWS Service:** AWS Systems Manager (Patch Manager & Inventory)

**Description:**  
Ensuring consistent configuration and timely patching mitigates vulnerabilities that could compromise system operations and data integrity.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Use **Systems Manager Inventory** to collect data about instances, configurations, and software versions.  
2. Schedule **Patch Manager** jobs to automatically apply approved updates.  
3. Test patches in a controlled staging environment before production rollout.  
4. Track patch compliance through Systems Manager reports.  
5. Review and remediate noncompliant systems quarterly.

---

## **Control 4: Data Backup and Recovery Monitoring**

**SOC 2 Reference:** CC7.4 – The entity responds to and recovers from system disruptions.

**AWS Service:** AWS Backup

**Description:**  
AWS Backup automates the creation and management of data backups, ensuring data resilience and supporting business continuity requirements.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Define **backup plans** for critical workloads, including backup frequency and retention.  
2. Enable **cross-region or cross-account backups** for disaster recovery scenarios.  
3. Monitor backup jobs for failures using **AWS Backup Audit Manager**.  
4. Periodically test data recovery procedures to ensure RTO and RPO compliance.  
5. Store backup evidence (logs, reports, test results) for SOC 2 audit validation.

---

## **Control 5: GRC Oversight and Evidence Mapping**

**SOC 2 Reference:** CC7.1–CC7.5 – The entity implements monitoring, incident management, and recovery activities that support operational resilience.

**AWS and GRC Integration:** AWS Audit Manager, AWS Config, GRC Platforms (e.g., Drata, Archer, Vanta)

**Description:**  
GRC teams maintain a structured approach to mapping AWS operational controls to SOC 2 CC7 criteria, ensuring continuous monitoring and audit readiness.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Use **AWS Audit Manager’s SOC 2 Framework** to track evidence for operational controls.  
2. Map CloudWatch, Systems Manager, and AWS Backup activities to CC7.x criteria.  
3. Define compliance metrics in the GRC system to monitor control performance.  
4. Conduct periodic internal reviews to ensure operational data (logs, metrics, evidence) remains current.  
5. Integrate GRC platforms with AWS services to automate evidence collection and reporting.

## **GRC Mapping Table**

| AWS Service / Control Area  | SOC 2 Reference | Supporting Artifacts | GRC Mapping Objective |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| CloudWatch Monitoring        | CC7.1, CC7.2    | Metrics, alarms, dashboards | Monitor and detect system anomalies |
| Systems Manager Automation   | CC7.2, CC7.3    | Runbooks, OpsCenter records | Automate incident detection and remediation |
| Patch Management             | CC7.3           | Patch compliance reports, logs | Ensure timely remediation of vulnerabilities |
| AWS Backup                   | CC7.4           | Backup jobs, recovery test results | Support data resilience and disaster recovery |
| GRC Oversight (Audit Manager) | CC7.1–CC7.5    | Evidence matrix, control mappings | Demonstrate continuous monitoring and audit readiness |

Implementing system monitoring, automation, and backup processes through **CloudWatch**, **Systems Manager**, and **AWS Backup** enables proactive system operations aligned with SOC 2 CC7 requirements.  
By integrating these AWS services with GRC oversight and automated evidence collection, organizations can achieve continuous compliance and operational resilience.
