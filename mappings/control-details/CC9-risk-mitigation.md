# CC9: Risk Mitigation  
### Reference: AICPA Trust Services Criteria 2017, CC9.1–CC9.2

## Overview
The **Risk Mitigation** criteria address how an organization identifies, selects, and develops activities to mitigate risks arising from potential business disruptions, vendor relationships, and external threats.  

SOC 2 CC9 includes two key principles:
- **CC9.1:** Identify and develop risk mitigation activities for business disruption.
- **CC9.2:** Assess and manage risks associated with vendors and business partners.

## Mapping AWS Security Services to CC9 Controls
AWS provides several managed services that align directly with SOC 2 CC9 requirements by helping detect, mitigate, and respond to threats.  
Below are four mapped controls and their relevance for Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) teams preparing for SOC 2 audits.

---

### **Control 1: AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)**
**SOC 2 Mapping:** CC9.1 – Risk Mitigation Activities  
**Description:**  
AWS WAF protects web applications from common web exploits such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), which can disrupt business operations or compromise sensitive data.

**Implementation Guidance:**  
- Deploy AWS WAF on Application Load Balancers (ALB), CloudFront distributions, or API Gateway endpoints.  
- Define and test managed rule groups aligned with OWASP Top 10.  
- Monitor logs via Amazon CloudWatch for alerting on blocked or allowed traffic.  

**GRC Mapping Insight:**  
WAF policies and rule documentation serve as **evidence of risk mitigation controls** that reduce exposure to web-based disruptions and data breaches.  
Auditors can review WAF configuration baselines and change logs to verify ongoing compliance.

### **Control 2: AWS Shield (Standard & Advanced)**
**SOC 2 Mapping:** CC9.1 – Business Disruption Mitigation  
**Description:**  
AWS Shield provides DDoS protection for applications hosted on AWS, automatically detecting and mitigating attacks to ensure service availability.

**Implementation Guidance:**  
- Enable AWS Shield Advanced for critical production workloads.  
- Integrate with AWS WAF for layered protection.  
- Configure response playbooks and incident escalation paths for detected DDoS events.  

**GRC Mapping Insight:**  
Shield logs and incident reports demonstrate how the entity **monitors and responds to external disruptions**, supporting the “mitigation of risks of business disruption” focus in CC9.1.

---

### **Control 3: Amazon GuardDuty**
**SOC 2 Mapping:** CC9.1 & CC9.2 – Risk Identification and Management  
**Description:**  
GuardDuty continuously monitors AWS accounts, workloads, and data for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior using threat intelligence and anomaly detection.

**Implementation Guidance:**  
- Enable GuardDuty organization-wide through AWS Organizations.  
- Configure alerts to route to Security Hub or SIEM tools for triage.  
- Review findings regularly and document risk responses.  

**GRC Mapping Insight:**  
GuardDuty supports **proactive detection and mitigation** of threats across vendor and infrastructure layers.  
Evidence such as GuardDuty findings and remediation logs map to SOC 2 expectations for **continuous monitoring and vendor risk management** under CC9.2.

---

### **Control 4: Amazon Macie**
**SOC 2 Mapping:** CC9.2 – Vendor and Confidentiality Risk Management  
**Description:**  
Amazon Macie automates the discovery and classification of sensitive data, such as PII, within S3. This reduces confidentiality risks from vendors, partners, or misconfigured resources.

**Implementation Guidance:**  
- Enable Macie across accounts handling sensitive or regulated data.  
- Schedule periodic data classification scans and generate sensitivity reports.  
- Integrate Macie findings with AWS Security Hub or ticketing systems for remediation.  

**GRC Mapping Insight:**  
Macie findings provide auditors with **evidence of data discovery and protection measures**, supporting the entity’s controls around **vendor and data confidentiality risk** per CC9.2.

## GRC Audit Preparation
To map these AWS services to SOC 2 CC9 requirements, GRC teams should:
1. **Document control design** — Describe how each AWS service mitigates specific risk types (e.g., DDoS, intrusion, data leakage).  
2. **Maintain configuration evidence** — Export WAF rules, Shield protection reports, GuardDuty findings, and Macie classification logs.  
3. **Define ownership and accountability** — Assign control owners for each service.  
4. **Integrate with policy frameworks** — Map AWS control evidence to policies such as Incident Response, Business Continuity, and Vendor Management.  
5. **Conduct control testing** — Review operational effectiveness quarterly through simulated attacks or compliance checks.

## Summary Table

| AWS Service | SOC 2 Control | Primary Objective | Evidence for Auditors | Key Risk Mitigated |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| **AWS WAF** | CC9.1 | Web application protection | WAF rule configs, CloudWatch logs | Exploits & data breaches |
| **AWS Shield** | CC9.1 | DDoS mitigation | Incident reports, protection summaries | Business disruption |
| **GuardDuty** | CC9.1 / CC9.2 | Threat detection | GuardDuty findings, remediation plans | Account compromise, insider threats |
| **Macie** | CC9.2 | Data classification & privacy | Macie reports, scan results | Data leakage, vendor exposure |
