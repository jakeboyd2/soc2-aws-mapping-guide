## Audit Preparation Tips

### Evidence Organization Best Practices
1. Maintain evidence **throughout** audit period  
2. Organize by **control ID (TSC reference)**  
3. Document **sampling approach** (auditors often select ~25 items)  
4. Keep evidence **centrally accessible** with naming conventions  
5. Use **version control** for policies and procedures  
6. Include **narratives** describing control operation  

### Common Auditor Requests
- Population listings for sampling  
- Traceability from policy → procedure → execution evidence  
- Period coverage throughout the audit period  
- Exception and remediation documentation  
- Management review evidence  

### Pre-Audit Validation (2 Weeks Before)
- [ ] Test sample evidence retrieval  
- [ ] Verify completeness of quarterly collections  
- [ ] Confirm current versions of all policies  
- [ ] Review for evidence gaps  
- [ ] Prepare management representation letter  
- [ ] Schedule key personnel for interviews
