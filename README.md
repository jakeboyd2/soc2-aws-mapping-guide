This guide helps organizations preparing for **SOC 2 Type II certification** understand:
- Which AWS services address each SOC 2 control
- How to implement security and compliance controls on AWS
- What evidence auditors require for each control
- Estimated costs for implementing compliance controls

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Understanding SOC 2

SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls 2) is an auditing procedure that ensures service providers securely manage data to protect the interests of their organization and the privacy of their clients.

**SOC 2 Type I**: Audit at a point in time  
**SOC 2 Type II**: Audit over a period (typically 6-12 months)

### Trust Service Categories

SOC 2 is organized into five Trust Service Categories:

| Category | Description | Documentation |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Common Criteria (CC)** | Fundamental controls applicable to all systems | [View Details](docs/common-criteria.md) |
| **Availability** | System is available for operation and use | [View Details](docs/availability.md) |
| **Confidentiality** | Confidential information is protected | [View Details](docs/confidentiality.md) |
| **Processing Integrity** | System processing is complete, valid, accurate, timely, and authorized | [View Details](docs/processing-integrity.md) |
| **Privacy** | Personal information is collected, used, retained, disclosed, and disposed properly | [View Details](docs/privacy.md) |

## üìä AWS Service Mapping Overview

### Core AWS Services for SOC 2 Compliance

## üìñ Implementation Guide

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Assessment Phase** (Weeks 1-2)
   - Review your current AWS architecture
   - Identify applicable Trust Service Criteria
   - Gap analysis against SOC 2 requirements

2. **Planning Phase** (Weeks 3-4)
   - Design control implementation
   - Define policies and procedures
   - Establish monitoring and logging

3. **Implementation Phase** (Weeks 5-12)
   - Deploy AWS services per control requirements
   - Configure security controls
   - Implement logging and monitoring

4. **Evidence Collection Phase** (6-12 months)
   - Collect evidence continuously
   - Document control effectiveness
   - Prepare for audit

## üìÅ Evidence Collection

Auditors require specific evidence for each control. Common evidence types:

- **Screenshots** of AWS console configurations
- **AWS Config** compliance reports
- **CloudTrail logs** demonstrating access controls
- **IAM policies** and permission configurations
- **CloudWatch** alerts and monitoring dashboards
- **Backup** and disaster recovery test results
- **Incident response** documentation
- **Change management** records from Systems Manager

## üí∞ Cost Estimation

### Estimated Monthly AWS Costs for SOC 2 Compliance

**Small Organization** (1-10 employees, single application):
- Basic compliance stack: $150-300/month
- Enhanced monitoring: +$100-200/month

**Medium Organization** (11-100 employees, multiple applications):
- Comprehensive compliance: $500-1,500/month
- Advanced security: +$500-1,000/month

**Enterprise Organization** (100+ employees, complex infrastructure):
- Full compliance suite: $2,000-5,000+/month
- Enterprise features: +$2,000-5,000+/month
